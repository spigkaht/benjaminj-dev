        <h4>...more detail</h4>
        <p>My current employer was using a few outdated applications that were inefficient for users and adding little value to the business. We decided to utilise the skills I had been gaining and I wrote an app for internal use, the plan being we would replace the existing apps. It allows users to handle item returns into our store (think returning a car rental), ‘prehire checks’ which are undertaken before items are ready for their next rental, and reports on a few different data items.</p>
        <p>There is no limit for what functionality could be added in future updates. This app most definitely pushed me to the edge of my capabilities quite a few times. The database for reading rental data is fixed and uneditable - leading to two databases working in sync. Turbo frames & streams, mailers, pdf generation, there are quite a few processes involved that are outside of the norm.</p>
